        <p>
            Ride the waves with our sea scooter or go snorkelling
             and explore the underwater beauty of Infanta, Quezon.

        <h2>SARIAYA, QUEZON</h2>

        <p>It is summer time, in the middle of June. The smell of the salty air, 
            cool breeze of the gulf coast is enough to make my heart flutter.
             As I look out into the beautiful clear blue sky, I see it filled 
             with kites of many colors, shapes and sizes.

        <h2>LUCENA, CITY QUEZON</h2>
        <p>The radiant rays of the neon sun reflect off 
            of the untouched white sand that covers the ground 
            as far as the eye can perceive. These perfectly placed 
            grains of sand shine like flawlessly polished diamonds.

        <h2>UNISAN, QUEZON</h2>
        <p>The breathtaking panoramic view is enough 
            to make your knees go weak. The bright, round
             sun blinds you as it appears rising and climbing 
             like a yellow lemon on the horizon.

        <h2>MACALELON, QUEZON</h2>
        <p>Immediately upon arrival I headed to the
             beach and buried my feet in the gleaming 
             hot white sand. I stood on the edge of this breathtaking
              tropical island and saw water so blue, that it more resembled liquid sapphire. </p>

        <h2>MULANAY, QUEZON</h2>
        <p>The sand scorched our feet like steaks 
            on a fiery grill. I had brought the Rock 
            along to join me for a surfing lesson. We 
            snatched our wetsuits and our boards and hit the waves. 
            The ocean water sends a chilling sensation through my body.

        <h2>SAN FRANCISCO, QUEZON</h2>
        <p>The beach’s ambience was relaxing yet hectic. 
            Parents were lying on their large beach towels, 
            soaking in the sun such as a sponge would absorb water. 
            All the while, their young children were splashing and running 
            through the froth of the waves.
